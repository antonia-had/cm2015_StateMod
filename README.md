# cm2015_StateMod

This repository combined that Upper Colorado StateMod dataset from https://cdss.colorado.gov/modeling-data/surface-water-statemod
and the StateMod executable compiled for Linux from https://github.com/OpenCDSS/cdss-app-statemod-fortran. 

There are no changes to the original data or code besides the reoperation variable `ireopx` in the `cm2015.ctl` file.
